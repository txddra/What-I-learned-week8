has been interesting to say the least;

- we've built a couple of apps
- we got more information about arrays and array methods
- were taught about for..of loops

 ### personal

 I'm still a bit shaky on the index side of things,
 as well as if statements.
 but I'm looking forward to getting more educated.

### Summary

# Array Methods:
- **map**
- **filter**
- **reduce**... (not really)

 ## Map :
The **map()** method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

## Filter :
The **filter()** method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
